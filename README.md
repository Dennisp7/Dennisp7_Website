# Personal Website

In this project, I leveraged my education in human-computer interaction, user experience, basic software engineering, and web design to create a low-fidelity website prototype for a personalized, improved, and consolidated version of LinkedIn. This is meant to be a virtual extension of my resume.

The website is a template created by @davidtmiller. My tutor Ediel Lopez and I, made modifications to the HTML and CSS to mold the source code around my information.
